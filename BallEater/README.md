# BallEater
My personal android game.
Description:
 I have a box which I can move upward any time I touch the screen and go backward when I release the touchscreen. It has conditions for establishing the number of points accumulated each time you get a ball in the box and a condition for ending the game (when you touch the bomb).
 
 # How to play:
 Any time you touch the screen the box will move upward. You get points for touching the balls that are coming to you. The game ends when you touch the bomb.
